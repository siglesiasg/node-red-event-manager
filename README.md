## Overview

This repository contains custom nodes for Node-RED that enhance event management capabilities. The nodes include:

- **Event Manager Dispatcher:** Emits messages based on slot availability, storing them in memory until a free slot becomes available. Configuration options include dynamic updates for maximum concurrency.

- **Event Manager Checkpoint:** Allows marking the completion of message execution and enables the emission of new messages from the `event-manager-dispatcher` node.

### Key Features

- Efficient event management for Node-RED flows.
- Dynamic configuration for maximum concurrency.
- Seamless integration with the Node-RED environment.
